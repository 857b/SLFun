Comparison with Steel
=========================================

Vprops
Type refinements on the selectors
direct VC generation vs. functional representation
functional representation on top of Steel
SteelGhost vs interactive proofs in SL

Better integration with F\*: effects, ghost code
Concurrency: atomic code, invariants, ghost cells using arbitrary monoids
